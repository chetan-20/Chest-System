# Chest-System

Made a Clash Royale like Chest System.

Used MVC pattern for the chest to seperate the visual , logic and data.

Used Scriptable object to store the data for the Chest.

Used Service Locator pattern that holds all the necessary references of the Game and provides acess to them from one single point.

Used State Machine Design Pattern for diferrent states of the chest(Locked,Unlocking,Unlocked,Collected). 

Used Coroutine for PopUp Like effect to display messages.
